# Thinking of Internet Addresing

## Abstract
The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success  in information technology of the last half century.  As the Internet  becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions.  However, there are specific scenarios that showcase possibly different addressing requirements, which are challenging to be accommodated in the IP addressing model.  These scenarios highlight issues related to the Internet addressing model and call for starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve the addressing model so to better accommodate different domain-specific requirements.
